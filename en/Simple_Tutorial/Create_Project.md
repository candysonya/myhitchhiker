Only project's owner can remove member from this project. Owner also can disband project then every member will lose this Project and collections of it.

Notice there is a `localhost` column that every member can edit it. It's used for debug your localhost API, `localhost` for server is server itself, you have to make server known where your computer are, so change `localhost` to your IP and when send a request with host `localhost`, server will change host to your IP get from this mapping.
